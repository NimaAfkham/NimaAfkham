Hey there! I'm Nima Afkham ðŸ˜Ž
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate, curious, and slightly caffeinated computer engineering student who loves diving into all things code. Iâ€™m currently studying Artificial intelligence Masters at Isfahan University of Technology (IUT).

About Me:
I'm the type whoâ€™s always looking to learn something newâ€”whether it's a new Python trick, a cool network protocol, or just an excuse to mess around with code. Iâ€™ve been tackling Project Euler problems (because who doesnâ€™t love a good challenge, right?), building prediction models, and putting my skills to the test with every project I can get my hands on.

What I Do ->
ðŸ›  Backend Dev Enthusiast: 
Backend is my playground. I work mainly with Python and Django , building solid systems and diving into databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.

ðŸ¤– Wannabe Data Wizard: 
Iâ€™m dabbling in machine learning, having built a couple of prediction modelsâ€”one for diabetes and another to predict bank loan approvals. Itâ€™s early days, but hey, everyone starts somewhere!

ðŸ“š Forever Learning: 
Right now, Iâ€™m geeking out on networking with Network+ and catching up on Git and GitHub magic. And Iâ€™m also eyeing Qt for future GUI fun with Python and C++.

Fun Facts :
ðŸ’¡ I like to keep things interesting by learning the most random tech facts, so there's always something fun to chat about.
â˜• Yes, caffeine fuels my code. Enough said.
ðŸŒ± Always on a journey to make the impossible... slightly more possible.
Thanks for dropping by! If youâ€™re into tech, learning, or just want to connect, reach out! Letâ€™s make something awesome.
